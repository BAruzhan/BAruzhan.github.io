 Little about Arduino:
 Arduino - an electronic designer and convenient platform rapid development of electronic devices for beginners and professionals . The platform is very popular all over the world thanks to the convenience and ease of programming language, as well as an open architecture and software code. The device is programmed via USB without using programmers.
 
 Today was particularly interesting day! Because we worked with Arduino. Before this day I have only heard that Arduino is exist, but on the today lesson I take more new experience and knowledge.
 Also I had good partner, who was funny, and together we made many exercises.But one time we couldn't install melody, then Sana help us and we heard sweet melody. If we will work so often we know about each other more information than now.
 In addition I want to say that this knowledge will useful when I will write ROBOTICS test!
 Special thanks to our teacher, Sherol Chen, who learn us be honest and help other student!
