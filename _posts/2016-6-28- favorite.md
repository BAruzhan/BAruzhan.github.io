1) Arduino.Develops motor skills of hands,because you have to connect the wires, and it is very thin and do such work often,logic and critical thinking.Also we take more information, when we practise our skills , than remember out books.It was funny and informative.

2)Github - this is social networks for developer, as we now. We can write here different code out of processing project or other programm or project and then we can see ready project interface in the own web site, which appeared automatically. Also we can make in the Github different project, create new repository,write blog about things, which interested him and we made all of this FREE! ( Last one is joke)
